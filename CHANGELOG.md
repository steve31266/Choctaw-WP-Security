## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **WP Core Verify-Checksums** admin scan on the settings page.
  - Compares installed WordPress core files against official WordPress.org checksums for the current version and locale using `get_core_checksums()`.
  - Reports modified files, missing files, and unknown files in core-owned areas (`ABSPATH` root core files, `wp-admin/`, and `wp-includes/`).
  - Excludes site-specific paths such as `wp-config.php`, `wp-content/`, `.htaccess`, and common local root files from false-positive reporting.
  - Caps displayed unknown files at 50 and notes when additional unknown files were found.
  - Detection-only: does not repair, delete, quarantine, or modify files.
  - Includes timeout protection and grouped result output on manual **Scan Now** action.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Uploads PHP lockdown** — optional security feature (enabled by default) to block PHP execution in `wp-content/uploads`.
  - On Apache, LiteSpeed, and OpenLiteSpeed, the plugin manages a marker block in `wp-content/uploads/.htaccess`.
  - On Nginx, the plugin shows a copyable server configuration snippet and reports that manual setup is required.
  - On unknown servers, the plugin attempts `.htaccess` enforcement when the uploads directory is writable and reports whether the managed block was installed.
- **Server-aware enforcement status** on the settings page, including labels such as *Protected by managed .htaccess block*, *Manual Nginx configuration required*, and *Unable to write uploads .htaccess*.
- **Recent File Changes** panel listing last-modified times for stable WordPress core and configuration files commonly targeted during compromises.
- **PHP Files in Uploads and Must-Use Plugins** panel to surface suspicious PHP files in `wp-content/uploads` and `wp-content/mu-plugins`.
